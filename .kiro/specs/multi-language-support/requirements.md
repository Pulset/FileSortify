# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive multi-language support to FileSortify, enabling users to switch between Chinese and English languages throughout the application interface. The system will default to Chinese and provide seamless language switching capabilities while maintaining user preferences across sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to display in Chinese by default, so that I can use the app in my preferred language from the first launch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts for the first time THEN the system SHALL display all UI text in Chinese
2. WHEN no language preference is stored THEN the system SHALL default to Chinese language
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL apply the Chinese language to all interface elements including menus, buttons, labels, and messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between Chinese and English languages, so that I can use the application in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the settings or preferences THEN the system SHALL provide a language selection option
2. WHEN I select a different language THEN the system SHALL immediately update all visible UI text to the selected language
3. WHEN I switch languages THEN the system SHALL update text in all components including Dashboard, LogsView, OrganizeView, RulesView, Sidebar, and SubscriptionView
4. WHEN I change the language THEN the system SHALL persist my language preference for future sessions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my language preference to be remembered across application restarts, so that I don't have to reconfigure the language each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a language preference THEN the system SHALL store this preference in the application configuration
2. WHEN I restart the application THEN the system SHALL load and apply my previously selected language
3. WHEN the stored language preference is corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL fallback to Chinese as the default language

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all application text including error messages and notifications to be translated, so that I have a consistent multilingual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL show them in the currently selected language
2. WHEN system notifications are shown THEN the system SHALL display them in the currently selected language
3. WHEN tooltips and help text are displayed THEN the system SHALL present them in the currently selected language
4. WHEN subscription-related messages are shown THEN the system SHALL translate them to the current language

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a maintainable translation system, so that adding new languages or updating translations is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new UI text is added THEN the system SHALL support easy addition of translations for both languages
2. WHEN translation keys are missing THEN the system SHALL fallback to a default language or show the translation key
3. WHEN the translation system is implemented THEN it SHALL support nested translation keys for organized content
4. WHEN translations are loaded THEN the system SHALL handle loading errors gracefully without breaking the application
